#IIFE Sandwich Maker

## Description
Exercise for augmented IIFEs. To run the sandwich maker, we had to make an augmented IIFE for each ingredient, and ultimately, combine them in one main.js file which handled output to the DOM.

## How to run
In your terminal, run:
```
http-server -p 4040
```
then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser.
